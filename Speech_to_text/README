This folder contains all the code for Speech to text.
The implemtation has been done in two ways to compare the performance of each individual model sperately.

First model is by using an LSTM recurrent Neural Network with CTC as the loss function.
The file named "lstm_ctc_model.py" contains all the code for the same.

Second model is by using a dislated convolution neural network using CTC as the loss function.
The file named "dialated_convolution_ctc_model.py" contains all the code for the same.

"creatingdataset.py" is the script used for loading the wav file and correspoing txt (transcript) files and making a matrix used to feed into the model.
